Whimsical Toys Inc (WTI) needs to record the names of all its employees. Every month, an employee will be chosen at random from these records to receive a free toy.
Use a List. Choose a random employee by picking a number between 0 and size()-1.

WTI has decided that each new product will be named after an employee â€” but only first names will be used, and each name will be used only once. Prepare a list of unique first names.
Use a Set. Elements in Set are always unique.

WTI decides that it only wants to use the most popular names for its toys. Count up the number of employees who have each first name.
Use a Map, with key value pair of first names and count of the number of employees with that first name.

WTI acquires season tickets for the local lacrosse team, to be shared by employees. Create a waiting list for this popular sport.
